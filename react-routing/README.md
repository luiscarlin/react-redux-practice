## React Routing

- Single page applications (SPAs) are web apps that load the whole site as a single html page
- Work then is done in the front end for navigation
- No more page reloads because the client updates the view dynamically
- Routing handles what page will be shown to the user
- The URL can remain static or could change to provide the perception of navigability
- To start, do `npm install --save reat-router`
