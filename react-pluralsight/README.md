## React Advanced: Building an isomorphic full-stack app with React and Express

### Introduction

#### React

- What:
  - React is a Javascript library in which components are defined and eventually become HTML
  - React abstracts away the DOM from you, giving a simpler programming model and better performance
- Why:
  - Renders views very fast because of JS shadow/ virtual dom
  - Easy to test because you use JS to create HTML
  - Used/ maintained by Facebook
- How:
  - JSX -> JS -> virtual DOM -> display into real DOM -> update data model -> update real DOM when virtual DOM changes

#### Express

- What:
  - Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js
