## ReactJS with Redux

### Notes


### Get Started

- install -> `npm install --save redux`
- Redux works standalone and doesn't need React, so we need to import react-redux to make their connection
- install -> `npm install --save react-redux`
- Bring any state you used in your components to use redux instead
