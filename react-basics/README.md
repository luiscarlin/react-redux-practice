  - ReactJS is used to build UIs. Needs other packages to add features.
  - AngularJS is used to build SPA (UIs, form validation, routing, etc) with all features loaded by default
  - AngularJS controls the complete user experience
  - ReactJS can be used as part of other type of applications (Lavarel, Angular, etc). Angular cannot do that
